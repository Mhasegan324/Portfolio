## Quick Notes
* This was my first real data analytics case study so I was excited but also a little nervous when I realized that there were approx. 5.6m rows of data.
    * After a little practice, it ended up getting me very comfortable with excel.
* After doing some data manipulation on all 12 month datasets, I divided those up into trimester datasets and evaluated the three trimesters throughout the year. You can find my analysis on those in the Journal.pdf.
* Then, I combined those trimester datasets into a full year dataset on which I conducted my analysis.

* I got a great learning experience from this case study and enjoyed it a lot.
* I am open to criticism. Please contact me via email or LinkedIn for any corrections, improvements, or suggestions.
